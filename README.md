Touch20 - Touchscreen support for Roll20
=====================================

If you play Pen & Paper or Tabletop games online, you probably know about Roll20 (https://roll20.net/). 
It's a tremendous system for bringing players from all over the world to one table and going on an adventure. 

I was part of an online Pen & Paper roleplaying group. After three years of playing online, we decided to 
take our game to the next level and meet up in real life. To be able to play our favorite game at a real table, we 
wanted to use my convertible laptop as a big touchscreen device in the center of the table. Unfortunately, Roll20 
doesn't support touch screens - neither with a stylus nor with bare fingers.

**But fear not - Touch20 is here!**

Touch20 is an extension for Google Chrome which adds touchscreen support to Roll20. Features:

  * Drag and Drop your characters to move them
  * Pan the map with two fingers to move the viewport
  * Pinch with two fingers to zoom in or out
  * Long-press to activate the right-click menu
  * Enlarged the left-hand toolbar to make the icons easier to hit using the touch controls
  * Full support for both fingers and styluses (pens)
  * Touch also works in dialogs (i.e. Turn Order, Character sheets, ...) and the assets menu
